# A-Multi-AI-based-AMC
Automatic modulation classification for BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and OFDM (MATLAB)

OFDM signals were generated in 50M.m
A: create raw signals and images (real-world data, SNR=10, SNR=15)
B: extract features of signals (500 samples and 5000 samples)
C: image network and feature network

dataset is provided in compressed folder.
